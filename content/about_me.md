I'm a student, apprentice, hobbyist, and generally a nerd who does some coding every once and a while.
I've mainly been messing with C, C++, C# and have been learning Rust. I'm presently learning more about web development, particularly regarding frameworks and libraries.  
I'm a bit shy in terms of socializing, but I'm often open to chat about most things, so long as it's respectful.
Please reach out to me first, I probably won't do so myself.

Follow if you enjoy. I'm not *too* active, but I'll try to post some things every once and a while.
